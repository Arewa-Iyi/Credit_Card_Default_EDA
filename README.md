# Credit_Card_Default_EDA

## Introduction
This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) evaluating features that help determine the likelihood of client default using the dataset collected from the 2009 Default of Credit Card Clients research. The dataset contains client information from a Taiwanese bank, including credit limit, age, and sex, as well as the six-month payment history from April to September 2005, and the target feature, default status in October. 
## Risk Analysis
The process of analyzing the probability that a borrower will default on a credit card loan is called Credit Default Risk Analysis. There are three primary considerations during analysis: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD). To make informed decisions on interest rates and credit limit extensions, lenders must leverage statistical and quantitative models to analyze collected data and risk metrics to determine the probability of default at any time. This analysis investigates and prepares the data set for the credit risk model and summarizes key insights.
